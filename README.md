As a User,
I need a service that has a counter
So that I can keep track of how many times something has been done.

Details and Assumptions
New a way to increment a counter
Need a way to get the current value
Acceptance Criteria
Given I have incremented the counter to 2
When I make a call to get the current value
Then it should return 2 as the counter value
